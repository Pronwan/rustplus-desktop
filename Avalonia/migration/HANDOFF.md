# Avalonia migration handoff — 2026-10-16

## Workspace and authorization

- Repository: `D:\Development\rustplus-desktop`, branch `beta`; baseline `e1bf6594`.
- All migration work is in `Avalonia/`. Do not edit the original WPF application or unrelated `.serena/`.
- Preserve every shipped feature and nearly the same design. Windows uses FluentAvaloniaUI 3.1.0;
  Avalonia is 12.1.4 on .NET 10. Linux/macOS native appearance remains unfinished.
- Read `PROMPT.md` and `STATUS.md` before continuing. The migration is a preview, not production ready.
- At this checkpoint the migration is untracked/uncommitted; no migration commit or push exists yet.
  `git diff --exit-code` passed for tracked reference files. Do not mistake that for committed migration work.

## Latest resolved bug

Clicking Account → Sign in crashed in native Windows child-window creation. Windows Application
event 1026 showed `InvalidOperationException: Unable to create child window for native control host`.
The executable lacked a supported-OS compatibility manifest. Added `src/RustPlusDesk.Avalonia/app.manifest`
and `ApplicationManifest` to its project. Debug, Release and self-contained Windows executables were
checked for the embedded compatibility declaration. Do not remove it or replace window hosting blindly.

`tools/native-login-smoke/` exercises the actual production browser adapter with a local HTTP redirect,
then cancellation. Without the manifest it reproduced the exact crash; with it both checks passed.
WebView2 logged a Chrome class-unregister warning at shutdown, but the smoke exited 0 and did not crash.
The checks never used personal credentials or contacted Steam/Facepunch.

## Verified current source

- Debug/Release builds: zero warnings/errors. All 99 MSTest tests pass.
- Source-only external copy with separate package cache: 99 tests pass, zero warnings.
- Self-contained Release publishes on Windows: win-x64, linux-x64, osx-arm64 succeed.
- Native Windows browser callback and cancellation smoke passes. Native Linux/macOS executables untested.
- Two Python reference-capture tests passed in the earlier slice; its code has not changed since.
- External copy location is recorded locally in ignored `artifacts/isolation-path.txt`; its source copy
  includes the auth/crash fix but may precede final documentation and smoke-tool relocation.
- Rebuilt app: `src/RustPlusDesk.Avalonia/bin/Release/net10.0/RustPlusDesk.Avalonia.exe`.
- Self-contained Windows app: `artifacts/publish/win-x64/RustPlusDesk.Avalonia.exe`.

## Working preview

Saved-server browsing/editing with revision protection/backups, socket/direct connections and reconnect,
live server clock/status, confirmed device/group switches, alarm/storage state and subscriptions;
account modal with safe status, native browser sign-in, companion verification, FCM registration,
schema-preserving private credential writes, cancellation and failed-save registration rollback.
Unknown JSON is preserved; tokens are excluded from presentation and logs.

## Exact next steps

1. Validate real Steam/Facepunch return-URL callbacks on Windows. The native window crash is fixed;
   actual Steam authentication and FCM delivery have not been accepted. Do not claim complete sign-in parity.
2. Port the original pairing/push listener, persistent IDs and reconnect, server/device pairing events,
   then sign-out, device/account management and refresh/re-pair workflows. Never revoke earlier devices
   accidentally; current successful re-sign-in creates a new registration without deleting older ones.
3. Continue device editing/import/transfer/automation, original server menus/cloud-aware deletion,
   and the original sidebar/workspace layout. The full required backlog is in STATUS.md/reference checklist.
4. Run native Windows/Linux/macOS acceptance, including permissions, browser prerequisites and appearance.
5. Keep source upload-ready without parent-repo/private-submodule references. Exclude bin/obj/artifacts.

## Continuation commands (run from Avalonia)

```text
rtk proxy dotnet build RustPlusDesk.CrossPlatform.sln -c Release
rtk proxy dotnet test RustPlusDesk.CrossPlatform.sln -c Release
rtk proxy dotnet run --project tools/native-login-smoke/Smoke.csproj -c Release
```

Use graph discovery first (project `D-Development-rustplus-desktop`, Tier 2), then coverage checks.
Recent auth files had unavailable/stale graph coverage; exact source and runnable checks were used.
Local SDK reference `D:\Development\RustPlusApi` is unindexed. No exhaustive dead-code audit is claimed.

Latest account usage was 96% of the five-hour window, reset reported at 2026-10-16 17:21:05 Asia/Beirut.
At 97%, stop implementation and follow the user's commit/push checkpoint rule. Do not include unrelated
changes. No cloud transfer or scheduled resume has been configured. Cloud work must first have access to
this source; local uncommitted files are not automatically available while this PC is off.
