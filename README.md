# Rust+ Desktop App (Unofficial)



‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is an **unofficial** project and is not affiliated with Facepunch Studios or the game *Rust*.  

It is open source so anyone can verify there is **no malware or hidden components**.



---



## üîç What is this?



The **Rust+ Desktop App** is a Windows application built on the official Rust+ Companion API.  

It lets you pair Rust servers, monitor in-game events, control Smart Devices, and view dynamic map markers ‚Äî all on your PC.
By now it's more than 'just' Rust Plus. It's Rust¬≤ you could say... That's why this is our new icon ;) Was about time.
![Update](./icon.png)  


The app ships as a single installer (bundling .NET, Node.js, WebView2 runtime, RustPlusAPI, etc.), so you don‚Äôt have to install dependencies manually.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why initial NCM registration is required:
<details> 
   <summary> NCM Registration Explanation </summary>
On first launch, the app needs to establish a connection to the Rust+ Companion API.
For this, a bundled Node.js process (rustplus-cli) is started, which takes care of two things:

**Registration with Facepunch/Steam**

   - Opens a browser window to the official Rust+ Companion login page.

   - After logging in with Steam, an auth token is generated and passed back to the app.

   - This token is saved in the app‚Äôs config file so the process only needs to be done once per installation.

**Local listener for callbacks and notifications**

   - The Node process starts a small HTTP server on localhost:<random port> to receive the auth token.

   - Afterwards, it continues running as a background listener to receive notifications (chat, alarms, events) via Google FCM and forward them to the app.

**Requirements for successful registration**

   - Node.js runtime and rustplus-cli are shipped with the app ‚Äì no manual installation required.

   - Firewall/Antivirus must not block the Node process:

   - Local loopback (127.0.0.1) must be accessible for the callback port.

**Outbound connections must be allowed on:**

   - TCP 5228‚Äì5230 (Google FCM, mtalk.google.com)

   - TCP 443 (HTTPS to Steam, Facepunch, Google)

   - Browser redirect must be allowed (some security tools or proxies may block it).

   - A valid Steam login is required to complete the auth flow.

**üëâ After successful registration, the token is stored at**
%APPDATA%\RustPlusDesk\rustplusjs-config.json.
You only need to re-register if this file is missing or corrupted.
  </details>

<summary>üîß Troubleshooting Registration</summary>

If the initial pairing does not work (no browser window opens, or it keeps restarting):

- **Check if Node is running**  
  - Open *Task Manager* ‚Üí *Details* ‚Üí look for `node.exe`.  
  - Or run:  
    ```powershell
    tasklist | findstr node.exe
    ```

- **Check if a local port is listening**  
  - Run:  
    ```powershell
    netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING | findstr 127.0.0.1
    ```
  - You should see a `127.0.0.1:<port>` entry with the same PID as `node.exe`.  
  - If not: Firewall or antivirus may be blocking the local callback server.  

- **Check outbound connections**  
  Test if the required ports are open:  
  ```powershell
  Test-NetConnection mtalk.google.com -Port 5228
  Test-NetConnection companion-rust.facepunch.com -Port 443
  Test-NetConnection steamcommunity.com -Port 443
  All should return TcpTestSucceeded : True
- **Config reset**
If all else fails, close the app and delete:
%APPDATA%\RustPlusDesk\rustplusjs-config.json
On next launch the registration will run again.
