# Rust+ Desktop App (Unofficial)

⚠️ **Note**: This is an **unofficial** project and is not affiliated with Facepunch Studios or the game *Rust*.  
It is open source so anyone can verify there is **no malware or hidden components**.

## 🔍 What is this?

The **Rust+ Desktop App** is a Windows application built on the official Rust+ Companion API.  
It lets you pair Rust servers, monitor in-game events, control Smart Devices, and view dynamic map markers — all on your PC.

The app ships as a single installer (bundling .NET, Node.js, WebView2 runtime, RustPlusAPI, etc.), so you don’t have to install dependencies manually.
