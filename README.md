# Rust+ Desktop App (Unofficial)



‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is an **unofficial** project and is not affiliated with Facepunch Studios or the game *Rust*.  

It is open source so anyone can verify there is **no malware or hidden components**.



---



## üîç What is this?



The **Rust+ Desktop App** is a Windows application built on the official Rust+ Companion API.  

It lets you pair Rust servers, monitor in-game events, control Smart Devices, and view dynamic map markers ‚Äî all on your PC.
By now it's more than 'just' Rust Plus. It's Rust¬≤ you could say... That's why this is our new icon ;) Was about time.


The app ships as a single installer (bundling .NET, Node.js, WebView2 runtime, RustPlusAPI, etc.), so you don‚Äôt have to install dependencies manually.
